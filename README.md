### Uprank
SaaS tool to help you hire freelancers

## Why?
Online freelancer platforms have opened up a huge wave of opporunities for business to acquire talent fast. With millions of different options,
and lack of an unbiased rating system, it can be difficult for business owners to make good, data-driven decisions. These platforms offer metrics like
'job success score' or 'star ratings' but it is clear to everyone that 90% of all the freelancers have a 4+ star review, or a 90+ sucesss score. 
Uprank aims to use publicly available data and NLP techniques to empirically determine who the best freelancer is.
