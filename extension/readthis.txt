Background scripts: run continuosly, like listeners
content scripts: run in the context of a webpage

The extension should scrape the data and send all the data to the backend for processing
Then the background script should listen for the response and then send the update into the CSUI (I think this is how it works)

Basically CSUI is UI injected into the context of the webpage
CS (content script) is just typescript that runs in the context of the webpage.
These things communicate with Plasmo messages to the background 

Need to do:
Scraping
Authorization for the scraper
Figure out how to integrate with popup???

Popup used as a control center
1. Account management
2. Open new tab to manage added freelancers, can delete them 
3. Used to show the final displayed excel file, download results. 

Once on the page you have a add freelancer and a add job button?


Freelancer one is easy
