                "cv": "\ud83d\ude80 Hi, I'd like to help you with your website design needs! As a Figma-certified UI/UX designer with over 10 years of experience, I specialise in creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites that engage audiences and elevate brands. I'm well-equipped to bring your vision to life. \n\nTo help me better understand your design needs, please let me know:\n- Can you describe your target audience and what you want the website to achieve?\n- Do you have any specific design preferences or brand guidelines that you would like incorporated into the site?\n\nI'll design everything in Figma, work with you until you're happy with the final design and offer a reasonably unlimited number of revisions. Please see the attached portfolio for examples of my work, including examples of websites, SaaS apps and dashboard design projects.\n\nPlease feel free to schedule a call via my calendar to discuss the requirements in more detail: https://calendly.com/mnikolava\n\nBest regards,\nMariia",
