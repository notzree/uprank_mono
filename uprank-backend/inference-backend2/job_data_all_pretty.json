Our website is www.westernstateshemp.com. \n\nOnce the initial job is complete, we have monthly ongoing requests that we'd like to have an ongoing contract open for.  \n\nPlease submit previous work and sites you have done.",

The news are a combination of text, data and graphs that are produced every time there is a new data set available. \n\nProject details and timeline:\n\nWe have a first design draft of one typical page and and want to develop a complete prototype for the whole new portal. This includes design/usability for the mobile portal, newsletter, website and logo-design, but also a detailed specification so that afterwards we can quickly get an offer and start implementation, preferably with the same agency doing the prototype now, with the first part online by the end of November 2020. \n\nOn every page of the 103 regions, there shall be defined automated content, added manual posts, and the possibility to register for a regional newsletter, Google AdSense, own advertisements , Amazon Affiliate Marketing. Based on a rule, selected content shall be automatic published on Social Media (Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook). \n\nWe want to ideally finish the prototyp until latest beginning of November und ideally contract implementation immediately so that the first part is online still in November 2020. \n\nTechnological Requirements:\n\nThe health portal involves constantly downloading data files (mainly csv and json), transforming the data (e. g., correcting data, data mapping, calculating figures which are used then) and setting up a MySQL database to store and share processed data. Data shall also be easy manipulated (accessing data, but also changing data in the database) via Microsoft Excel. Processing the data will involve using Python. \n\nThe implementation after the prototype shall use WordPress and standard PlugIns as much as possible. A proposal for a good WordPress/database hoster in the European Union is welcome.  \n\nKey challenges we recognize:\n\nIt is key to (1) create an engaging mobile website with outstanding usability fort he target group (2) make the process of publishing and managing content on up to 103 different regional pages very easy (3) find a good but simple solution to implement the text generation for the posts and (4) employs as much automation as possible\n\nWhome are we looking for:\n\nWe look for an experienced designer/developer also considering front and back end implementation byeond pure design issues. An agency with a team of experts supporting him/her is preferred.\n\nWe have a clear ideas how the website should look like, but need someone to bring in his/her own ideas for ultimately having a new convincing health portal to make people return and engage. Very good English is needed, German language basic knowledge or experience with implementing software projects in German language is a plus. \n\nThe mentioned project budget is the overall budget including design, implementation, licence cost and overall maintenance for the next 6 months. The current offer shall only involve developing the prototype and working out the relevant specification und is obviously just a part of this budget.",

Our platform is doing what Progressive did for the insurance industry for Countertops: users come to the site, select the material they want to work with, provide their project details through our 'instant estimates' flow, and then compare quotes from providers in their area. \n\nWe need to redesign about 15 pages for both desktop and mobile, and to aid in this project, we have brand/demographic information aggregated into the following documents:\n\nBrand & Audience Onboard: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3ZmTm3BUDwPpxtm_qgRX3kuPAiUfraJG-xCCW4e2Vw/edit?usp=sharing \n\nPages to Redesign: https://docs.google.com/document/d/126wd3Y5Pq6TyfzPjIEZf5VGWH2TnvB9te-_hF_hlVmU/edit\n\nOur ideal partner is someone with healthy previous ecommerce experience. We need a tried and true professional to help us apply the information we have of our target demographic to our site and create a killer, unforgettable brand and user experience. We need someone who can help us make CountertopSmart the brand name for countertops across the nation. \n\nTo bid on this project, start by going through our site and applying your critical design eye to our current user experience. When sending your proposal, suggest one thing that you would immediately change on the site to make it better. This is our way of gauging how interested you are in taking this project (and to see if you read this far). We look forward to your proposals!\n\nBonus: Although this task is largely design oriented, if you have experience with front-end engineering and design implementation, that earns massive brownie points in our eyes! We're open to discussing the various price points associated with design only vs. design + implementation with this project.",

The page should effectively convey gratitude, confirm the user's action, provide information about next steps, offer optional social sharing, include links to relevant content, maintain a professional layout, and incorporate a clear call-to-action.\n\nKey Points to Include:\n\n1. Clear Thank You Message: Ensure the message of gratitude is clear and sincere. Utilize friendly and polite language to express appreciation.\n\n2. Confirmation of Action: Clearly reference the specific action the user has taken, in this case, requesting a quote.\n\n3. Information about Next Steps: Inform users about the next steps, such as waiting for a callback from Solar Xtra.\n\n4. Optional Social Shareability: Provide the option to share the thank you page on social media platforms to encourage users to share their experience and motivate others to take similar actions.\n\n5. Links to Relevant Content:\n   - FAQ: [FAQ Page](https://www.zonnepanelen-xtra.nl/faq/)\n   - Reviews: [Reviews Page](https://beoordelingen.mtmo.nl/zonnepanelen-xtra.nl)\n\n6. Professional Layout: Maintain a clean and professional layout for the page, including logos and relevant images, to uphold the brand identity.\n\n7. Call-to-Action (CTA): Include a clear call-to-action that encourages users to take further action, such as following the company on social media or exploring other pages on the website.\n\nReference Example: A good example to reference is Solar Concept's Thank You Page (https://www.solarconcept.nl/bedankt-voor-offerteaanvraag-besparing-berekenen). While they include a video, Solar Xtra does not have one. However, it provides a visual representation of the desired layout and elements.\n\n---\n\nNotes:\n- The thank you page should reflect the brand's tone and style.",

The aim is to make a user-friendly process that smoothly captures potential customers. Each step unfolds across various pages, demanding thoughtful design considerations. Here's a breakdown of the design specifics:\n\nStep 1: Introduction and Initial Details\nThis first step is a brief introduction and gathers basic information. Importantly, it's already part of the website, so there's no additional design needed here.\n\nStep 2: Household Consumption\nGive users space to input the number of people in their household and the kWh consumed. A backend calculator will handle the calculations.\n\nStep 3: Roof Details\nIn this stage, users specify their roof type (slanted or flat), orientation (wind direction), and dimensions (length and width). Implement four input fields to collect these details.\n\nStep 4: Quote and Contact\nThis pivotal step presents users with information on potential solar panels, energy generated, yearly savings, and the payback period. Also, gather essential visitor information - first name, last name, email, and phone number. This stage essentially marks their request for a quote before returning to the website.\n\nIt's crucial to ensure that the form is intuitive, providing a smooth user experience. Our goal is to prevent potential customers from dropping off due to complex forms. Take inspiration from the user-friendly form at [Solar Concept](https://www.solarconcept.nl/home/a).\n\nRefer to the concept design https://www.figma.com/file/zaTMk0pUXVVLjgaFWhco3R/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=FLx1gQBrYBvFcHA3-0 for clarity, illustrating the multiple steps and pages involved.\n\nLastly, make sure the design aligns seamlessly with the style of Solar Xtra's new homepage.\n\nLet's work together to create an exceptional quote form!\n\nBest regards,\n\nJorn",

The aim is to make a user-friendly process that smoothly captures potential customers. Each step unfolds across various pages, demanding thoughtful design considerations. Here's a breakdown of the design specifics:\n\nStep 1: Introduction and Initial Details\nThis first step is a brief introduction and gathers basic information. Importantly, it's already part of the website, so there's no additional design needed here.\n\nStep 2: Household Consumption\nGive users space to input the number of people in their household and the kWh consumed. A backend calculator will handle the calculations.\n\nStep 3: Roof Details\nIn this stage, users specify their roof type (slanted or flat), orientation (wind direction), and dimensions (length and width). Implement four input fields to collect these details.\n\nStep 4: Quote and Contact\nThis pivotal step presents users with information on potential solar panels, energy generated, yearly savings, and the payback period. Also, gather essential visitor information - first name, last name, email, and phone number. This stage essentially marks their request for a quote before returning to the website.\n\nIt's crucial to ensure that the form is intuitive, providing a smooth user experience. Our goal is to prevent potential customers from dropping off due to complex forms. Take inspiration from the user-friendly form at [Solar Concept](https://www.solarconcept.nl/home/a).\n\nRefer to the concept design https://www.figma.com/file/zaTMk0pUXVVLjgaFWhco3R/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=FLx1gQBrYBvFcHA3-0 for clarity, illustrating the multiple steps and pages involved.\n\nLastly, make sure the design aligns seamlessly with the style of Solar Xtra's new homepage.\n\nLet's work together to create an exceptional quote form!\n\nBest regards,\n\nJorn",

A modern, but common approach is ok. Exact colors, and specific assets not yet needed as this is MVP. Ideal candidate will be able to explain UX design process overall in order to efficiently develop an MVP. Success on this project may lead to further work to develop UX for the app. Multiple designers may be selected for different ideas. Suggestions on tools is welcome (proto vs figma vs balsamic etc).

Actual panel should be a very plush/smooth, high-gloss, reflective, white lacquer kind of aesthetic. Something halfway between Eva in Wall-E and the look/feel of the corridor design in the movie Moon (2009):\nhttps://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/moon-2009\n\nDon't need any additional environmental/scene based objects or backgrounds. Just the isolated panel. Panel dimensions are roughly the size of a 27\" computer monitor with 5 separate panes. An ultra-basic pane layout guide is attached.",

Netflix on TV (navigation using TV remote)\n2. Disney on TV (navigation using TV remote)\n3. Xbox screens (navigation using the game controller)\n4. Playstation (navigation using game controller)\n5.

The main goal of the app is to provide right data easily at the right time where it is needed and gather data/actions where and when they happens so usability is very important.\n\nAs a UI/UX designer you will be working directly and closely with the business architect who defines the goals, business processes, data model and functionalities of the app. A fluent English communication is essential.\n\nAs a UI/UX designer your responsibility is to suggest best practice for data visualisation and usability. Part of the job is also to create the actual components, UI:s and prototypes of the app with Figma so a strong skillset in that area and also icon designing skills are important.\n\nThe project is ongoing so the basic modern and clean look & feel is already set. There will be a lot of features and functionalities to be designed though.\n\nIf you decide to apply, please provide examples of similar projects and your thoughts about your approach and principals for designing such a data intensive, but user friendly apps,",

We will make our choice based on hour similar your design portfolio is to our visual brand, your experience with designing social media apps and Figma, competitive pricing, and how soon you can start.\n\nThe ability to capture our branding and design inspiration will be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nWhat's necessary:\n\n- Please add flows, hyperlinks, auto-layout, and interactions to the project so that it can work as an interactive prototype and can be quickly transferred into AWS code. \n- Please add scrollability, framing, and animations where necessary.\n- Please add branding and assets to the project (they have already been created) \n- Finish the development and styling of all input fields. \n- Style and brand all buttons wherever necessary.\n- Retain finished elements as components, styles, and in the library for further use. \n- Ensure design continuity, coherence, and intuitiveness wherever possible, and add additional screens if necessary (unlikely).\n\nTime to start: ASAP. \n\nTo apply: Please include your desired pricing, any portfolios you have, and when you can start. \n\nThanks.
